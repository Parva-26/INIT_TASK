# INIT TASK 

Name: Parva Mehta  

# TASK 1

# Short Approach / Summary
This task involves analyzing customer, product, and transaction data using Python.  
I started by loading and exploring the datasets, checked for missing values and duplicates, and converted timestamps to datetime format.  
Then I handled missing data (median for numeric and mode for categorical), merged all datasets, and created new columns such as revenue and profit margin.  
After cleaning, I performed different analyses like customer metrics, monthly revenue trends, top-performing products, and RFM segmentation.  
Finally, I added some advanced operations like detecting suspicious transactions, moving averages, and efficient vectorized operations.

# Short Note (Reflection / Implementation):

This paper was the foundation of modern deep learning in computer vision. My main takeaway was how powerful CNNs can be when trained on large datasets using GPUs. The techniques they introduced — like ReLU activation, dropout, and data augmentation — are now standard in almost every deep learning project.

If I were to implement or extend this work today, I’d try building a simpler version of AlexNet on smaller datasets like CIFAR-10, to understand each concept step by step. Later, I could apply transfer learning using pre-trained models on real-world tasks like image classification or object detection. It’s inspiring to see how this single paper shaped the direction of AI as we know it.
